# EMX â€” Emotional Mixing Matrix (Open Source)

EMX is a lightweight, interoperable **emotional mixing matrix** format and reference engine
for autonomous AI agents. It standardizes how emotions are represented, mixed, and evolved
over time in simulations, dialogue systems, and game AIs.

## Key points
- Interoperable matrix format + reference engine
- Deterministic core with pluggable heuristics
- Safety-aware fields (caps, inhibitors, guards)
- Apache-2.0 license

## Quick start (run without install)
```bash
pip install pyyaml
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/run_step.py
